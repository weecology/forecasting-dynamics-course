# State-space model forecasting

## State space models

* Time-series model
* Only first order autoregressive component
* Separately model
  * the process model - how the system evolves in time or space
  * the observation model - observation error or indirect observations
* Estimates the true value of the underlying **latent** state variables

## Data

* Google Flu Trends data for Florida
* [https://www.google.org/flutrends/about/data/flu/us/data.txt](https://www.google.org/flutrends/about/data/flu/us/data.txt)

```{r}
gflu = read.csv("http://www.google.org/flutrends/about/data/flu/us/data.txt",skip=11)
time = as.Date(gflu$Date)
y = gflu$Florida
plot(time,y,type='l',ylab="Flu Index",lwd=2,log='y')
```

> Draw on board while walking through models

```
y_t-1    y_t    y_t+1
  |       |       |
x_t-1 -> x_t -> x_t+1   Process model
```


### Process model

* What is actually happening in the system
* First order autoregressive component

x_t+1 = f(x_t) + e_t

* Simple linear model is AR1:

x_t+1 = b0 + b1 * x_t + e_t


### Observation model

* Google searches aren't perfect measures of the number of flu cases (which are
  what should be changing in the process model and what we care about)
* So model this imperfect observation

y_t = x_t + e_t

* Can be much more complicated


## Model Framework

* Models like this are not trivial to fit
* Use [JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net) to
  fit the model using Bayesian methods. The `rjags` library use R to call JAGS.

```{r}
library(rjags)
```


## Model

* JAGS code to describe the model
* Store as string in R
* Three components
  * data/error model
    * relates observed data (y) to latent variable (x)
    * Gaussian obs error
  * process model
    * relates state of the system at *t* to the state at *t-1*
    * random walk (x_t = x_t-1 + e_t)
  * priors
* Bayesian methods need priors, or starting points for model fitting

```{r}
RandomWalk = "
model{
  
  #### Data Model
  for(i in 1:n){
    y[i] ~ dnorm(x[i], tau_obs)
  }
  
  #### Process Model
  for(i in 2:n){
    x[i]~dnorm(x[i-1], tau_proc)
  }
  
  #### Priors
  x[1] ~ dnorm(x_ic, tau_ic)
  tau_obs ~ dgamma(a_obs, r_obs)
  tau_proc ~ dgamma(a_proc, r_proc)
}
"
```

* Data and priors as a list

```{r}
data <- list(y=log(y),
             n=length(y),
             x_ic=log(1000),
             tau_ic=100,
             a_obs=1,
             r_obs=1,
             a_proc=1,
             r_proc=1)
```

* Starting point of parameters

```{r}
init <- list(list(tau_proc=1/var(diff(log(y))),tau_obs=5/var(log(y))))
```

* Normally would want several chains with different starting positions to avoid
  local minima

* Send to JAGS

```{r}
j.model   <- jags.model (file = textConnection(RandomWalk),
                         data = data,
                         inits = init,
                         n.chains = 1)
```

* Burn in

```{r}
jags.out   <- coda.samples (model = j.model,
                            variable.names = c("tau_proc","tau_obs"),
                            n.iter = 1000)
plot(jags.out)
```

* Sample from MCMC with full vector of X's

```{r}
jags.out   <- coda.samples (model = j.model,
                            variable.names = c("x","tau_proc","tau_obs"),
                            n.iter = 10000)
```

* Visualize
* Convert the output into a matrix & drop parameters

```{r}
out <- as.matrix(jags.out)
xs <- exp(out[,3:ncol(out)])
```

* Point predictions are averages across MCMC samples

```
predictions <- colMeans(xs)
plot(time, predictions, type = "l")
points(time, y)
```

* Add prediction intervals as range containing 95% of MCMC samples

```
ci <- apply(xs, 2, quantile, c(0.025, 0.975))
lines(time, ci[1,], col = 'blue')
lines(time, ci[2,], col = 'red')
```

## Forecasting

* Add NAs for values to be forecast

> Make these changes at top of script and rerun

```
y = c(gflu$Massachusetts, rep(NA, 52))
time = c(as.Date(gflu$Date), seq.Date(as.Date("2015-08-16"), as.Date("2016-08-09"), "week"))
```

## Uncertainty

* The uncertainty is partitioned between process and observation models
* Look at `tau_proc` and `tau_obs` (as standard deviations)

```{r}
hist(1/sqrt(out[,1]))
hist(1/sqrt(out[,2]))
plot(out[,1], out[,2])
```
