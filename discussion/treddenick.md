* Why is it important to forecasting at large scales using dynamic models?
* Why is this hard?
* What new tools/data have the potential to make this possible?
* Qualitatively, what is the spatial component of the model doing?
* What are the four sets of simluations (computation experiments) performed in
  the paper?
* How does the model perform at predicting observed patterns?
* What changes does the model predict in the future?
* What are the sources of uncertainty shown in Figure 6 and how might they be
  reduced?
* How do the results of this study differ from species-distribution modeling
  based approaches and what does this tell us?
* Does the model using spatially explicit environmental factors and how might
  this influence the outcomes?
* How do the methods & predicted results differ from Homer et al. 2015 and what
  does this tell us about ecological forecasting?
