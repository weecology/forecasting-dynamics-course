## Forecastability?

* What influences our ability to forecast and how?
* Are there examples in ecology where a forecast could influence the thing being
  forecast?
  
## Forecasting, planning, and goals

* What kinds of time-scales of forecasts do we want/need in ecology?
* How might these different "forecasting horizons" influence our approaches to
  forecasting?

## Determining what to forecast

* How should we think about what to forecast in ecology?

## Forecasting data and methods

* What are the differences between explanatory and time-series models for
  forecasting?
* When might these different approaches be most appropriate in ecology?

## Case studies

* How do the case studies relate to ecological patterns or questions?
* How complicated are the case studies compared to ecological problems?

## Basic steps

* How do the "basic steps" of forecasting related to ecological forecasting?
